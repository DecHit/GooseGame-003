GOOSE GAME

Goose game is a game where two or more players move pieces around a track by rolling a die. 
The aim of the game is to reach square number sixty-three before any of the other players and avoid obstacles.

RUN THE EXAMPLE

If you want to run the examples in an IDE, such as Eclipse, you should
be able to copy-and-paste the entire contents of any one of the chapter folders
into a project in the IDE, and then run the programs. 

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have
downloaded the examples, you can easily compile and run all the examples.

If you find it easier to run programs by double-clicking, you can 
use clickable, executable jar files to run the examples, but you 
need to create the jar files.If you are running Windows, just open a DOS command window and change 
into the "sources" directory.  If you want to build jar files for JavaFX
files, edit the "make-jar-files.bat" script to tell it where to find
the JavaFX SDK. If you do not do this, the script will only build the
non-JavaFX jar files.
For the non-JavaFX files, you should be able to run an executable jar file
just by double-clicking it. 

HOW PLAY

When the game starts, as a player, you can add yourself to the game. You must use the command: "add player Pippo".
If you don't respect the command the system will send you an error message.
After you added some players you can start moving them.
You can move the players in two way:

- "move pippo"
- "move pippo 1, 2"

The first one let the game throws the dice for you.
The second one let you choose the number of the dice. Remember to put the space after the comma before the second number.
HAVE FUN!
